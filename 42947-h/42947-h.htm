<h2>A TRUE STORY.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class='smcap'>Little</span> Ann and her mother were walking one day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through London's wide city so fair,</span><br />
And business obliged them to go by the way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That led them through Cavendish Square.</span><br />
<br />
And as they pass'd by the great house of a Lord,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A beautiful chariot there came,</span><br />
To take some most elegant ladies abroad,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who straightway got into the same.</span><br />
<br />
The ladies in feathers and jewels were seen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The chariot was painted all o'er,</span><br />
The footmen behind were in silver and green,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The horses were prancing before.</span><br />
<br />
Little Ann by her mother walk'd silent and sad,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A tear trickled down from her eye,</span><br />
Till her mother said, "Ann, I should be very glad<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To know what it is makes you cry."</span><br />
<br />
"Mamma," said the child, "see that carriage so fair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">All cover'd with varnish and gold,</span><br />
Those ladies are riding so charmingly there<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">While we have to walk in the cold.</span><br />
<br />
"You say God is kind to the folks that are good,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But surely it cannot be true;</span><br />
Or else I am certain, almost, that He would<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Give such a fine carriage to you."</span><br />
<br />
"Look there, little girl," said her mother, "and see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What stands at that very coach door;</span><br />
A poor ragged beggar, and listen how she<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A halfpenny tries to implore.</span><br />
<br />
"All pale is her face, and deep sunk is her eye,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And her hands look like skeleton's bones;</span><br />
She has got a few rags, just about her to tie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And her naked feet bleed on the stones."</span><br />
<br />
'Dear ladies,' she cries, and the tears trickle down,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Relieve a poor beggar, I pray;</span><br />
I've wander'd all hungry about this wide town,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And not ate a morsel to-day.</span><br />
<br />
'My father and mother are long ago dead,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My brother sails over the sea,</span><br />
And I've scarcely a rag, or a morsel of bread,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As plainly, I'm sure, you may see.</span><br />
<br />
'A fever I caught, which was terrible bad,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But no nurse or physic had I;</span><br />
An old dirty shed was the house that I had,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And only on straw could I lie.</span><br />
<br />
'And now that I'm better, yet feeble and faint,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And famish'd, and naked, and cold,</span><br />
I wander about with my grievous complaint,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And seldom get aught but a scold.</span><br />
<br />
'Some will not attend to my pitiful call,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some think me a vagabond cheat;</span><br />
And scarcely a creature relieves me, of all<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The thousands that traverse the street.</span><br />
<br />
'Then ladies, dear ladies, your pity bestow:'&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just then a tall footman came round,</span><br />
And asking the ladies which way they would go,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The chariot turn'd off with a bound.</span><br />
<br />
"Ah! see, little girl," then her mother replied,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"How foolish those murmurs have been;</span><br />
You have but to look on the contrary side,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To learn both your folly and sin.</span><br />
<br />
"This poor little beggar is hungry and cold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No mother awaits her return;</span><br />
And while such an object as this you behold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your heart should with gratitude burn.</span><br />
<br />
"Your house and its comforts, your food and your friends,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis favour in God to confer,</span><br />
Have you any claim to the bounty He sends,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who makes you to differ from her?</span><br />
<br />
"A coach, and a footman, and gaudy attire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Give little true joy to the breast;</span><br />
To be good is the thing you should chiefly desire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then leave to <span class="smcap">God</span> all the rest."</span><br />
</div>




<h2>THE BOYS AND THE APPLE-TREE</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class='smcap'>As</span> William and Thomas were walking one day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They came by a fine orchard's side:</span><br />
They would rather eat apples than spell, read, or play,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Thomas to William then cried:</span><br />
<br />
"O brother, look yonder! what clusters hang there!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll try and climb over the wall:</span><br />
I must have an apple; I will have a pear;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Although it should cost me a fall!"</span><br />
<br />
Said William to Thomas, "To steal is a sin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mamma has oft told this to thee:</span><br />
I never have stolen, nor will I begin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So the apples may hang on the tree."</span><br />
<br />
"You are a good boy, as you ever have been,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said Thomas, "let's walk on, my lad:</span><br />
We'll call on our schoolfellow, Benjamin Green,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who to see us I know will be glad."</span><br />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 490px;">
<img src="images/i_010.jpg" width="490" height="485" alt="Two boys looking at an apple tree" />
</div>

<div class='poem'>
They came to the house, and ask'd at the gate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Is Benjamin Green now at home?"</span><br />
But Benjamin did not allow them to wait,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And brought them both into the room.</span><br />
<br />
And he smiled, and he laugh'd, and caper'd with joy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His little companions to greet:</span><br />
"And we too are happy," said each little boy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Our playfellow dear thus to meet."</span><br />
<br />
"Come, walk in our garden, this morning so fine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We may, for my father gives leave;</span><br />
And more, he invites you to stay here and dine:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a most happy day we shall have!"</span><br />
<br />
But when in the garden, they found 'twas the same<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They saw as they walk'd in the road;</span><br />
And near the high wall when those little boys came,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They started as if from a toad:</span><br />
<br />
"That large ring of iron, you see on the ground,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With terrible teeth like a saw,"</span><br />
Said their friend, "the guard of our garden is found,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And it keeps all intruders in awe.</span><br />
<br />
"If any the warning without set at naught,<br />
Their legs then this man-trap must tear:"<br />
Said William to Thomas, "So you'd have been caught,<br />
If you had leapt over just there."<br />
<br />
Cried Thomas in terror of what now he saw,<br />
"With my faults I will heartily grapple;<br />
For I learn what may happen by breaking a law,<br />
Although but in stealing an apple."<br />

<h2>SOPHIA'S FOOL'S-CAP.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class='smcap'>Sophia</span> was a little child,<br />
Obliging, good, and very mild,<br />
Yet lest of dress she should be vain,<br />
Mamma still dress'd her well, but plain.<br />
Her parents, sensible and kind,<br />
Wish'd only to adorn her mind;<br />
No other dress, when good, had she,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>But useful, neat simplicity.<br />
<br />
Though seldom, yet when she was rude,<br />
Or ever in a naughty mood,<br />
Her punishment was this disgrace,<br />
A large fine cap, adorn'd with lace,<br />
With feathers and with ribbons too;<br />
The work was neat, the fashion new,<br />
Yet, as a fool's-cap was its name,<br />
She dreaded much to wear the same.<br />
<br />
A lady, fashionably gay,<br />
Did to mamma a visit pay:<br />
Sophia stared, then whisp'ring said,<br />
"Why, dear mamma, look at her head!<br />
To be so tall and wicked too,<br />
The strangest thing I ever knew:<br />
What naughty tricks, pray, has she done,<br />
That they have put that fool's-cap on?"<br />

<h2>FRANCES KEEPS HER PROMISE</h2>


<div class='poem'>
"<span class='smcap'>My</span> Fanny, I have news to tell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your diligence quite pleases me;</span><br />
You've work'd so neatly, read so well,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">With cousin Jane you may take tea.</span><br />
<br />
"But pray remember this, my love,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Although to stay you should incline,</span><br />
And none but you should think to move,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I wish you to return at nine."</span><br />
<br />
With many thanks the attentive child<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Assured mamma she would obey:</span><br />
Whom tenderly she kiss'd, and smiled,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with the maid then went away.</span><br />
<br />
Arrived, the little girl was shown<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To where she met the merry band;</span><br />
And when her coming was made known,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All greet her with a welcome bland.</span><br />
<br />
They dance, they play, and sweetly sing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In every sport each one partakes;</span><br />
And now the servants sweetmeats bring,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With wine and jellies, fruit and cakes.</span><br />
<br />
Then comes papa, who says, "My dears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The magic lantern if you'd see,</span><br />
And that which on the wall appears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Leave off your play, and follow me."</span><br />
<br />
While Frances too enjoy'd the sight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where moving figures all combine</span><br />
To raise her wonder and delight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She hears, alas! the clock strike nine.</span><br />
<br />
"Miss Fanny's maid for her is come."&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Oh dear, how soon!" the children cry;</span><br />
They press, but Fanny will go home,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bids her little friends good bye.</span><br />
<br />
"See, dear mamma, I have not stay'd."<br />

"Here, Miss, are pretty birds to buy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A parrot or macaw so gay;</span><br />
A speckled dove with scarlet eye:<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"No, no, I thank you," said the child;</span><br />
"I'll have a beauteous cooing dove,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So harmless, innocent, and mild."</span><br />
<br />
"Your choice, my Fanny, I commend,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Few birds can with the dove compare;</span><br />
But, lest it pine without a friend,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I give you leave to choose a pair."</span><br />

<h2>CARELESS MATILDA.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
"<span class='smcap'>Again</span>, Matilda, is your work undone!<br />
Your scissors, where are they? your thimble, gone?<br />
Your needles, pins, and thread and tapes all lost;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>Your housewife here, and there your workbag toss'd.<br />
<br />
"Fie, fie, my child! indeed this will not do,<br />
Your hair uncomb'd, your frock in tatters, too;<br />
I'm now resolved no more delays to grant,<br />
To learn of her, I'll send you to your aunt."<br />
In vain Matilda wept, entreated, pray'd,<br />
In vain a promise of amendment made.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Arrived at Austere Hall, Matilda sigh'd,</span><br />
By Lady Rigid when severely eyed:<br />
"You read and write, and work well, as I'm told,<br />
Are gentle, kind, good-natured, and not bold;<br />
But very careless, negligent, and wild&mdash;<br />
You'll leave me, as I hope, a different child."<br />
<br />
The little girl next morn a favour asks;<br />
"I wish to take a walk."&mdash;"Go, learn your tasks,"<br />
Replies her aunt, "nor fruitlessly repine:<br />
Your room you'll leave not till you're call'd to dine."<br />
As there Matilda sat, o'erwhelm'd with shame,<br />
A dame appear'd, Disorder was her name:<br />
Her hair and dress neglected&mdash;soil'd her face,<br />
Her mien unseemly, and devoid of grace.<br />
<br />
"Here, child," said she, "my mistress sends you this,<br />
A bag of silks&mdash;a flower, not work'd amiss&mdash;<br />
A polyanthus bright, and wondrous gay,<br />
You'll copy it by noon, she bade me say."<br />
Disorder grinn'd, and shuffling walk'd away.<br />
<br />
Entangled were the silks of every hue,<br />
Confused and mix'd were shades of pink, green, blue;<br />
She took a thread, compared it with the flower:<br />
"To finish this is not within my power.<br />
Well-sorted silks had Lady Rigid sent,<br />
I might have work'd, if such was her intent."<br />
She sigh'd, and melted into sobs and tears:<br />
She hears a step, and at the door appears<br />
A pretty maiden, clean, well-dress'd, and neat,<br />
Her voice was soft, her looks sedate, yet sweet.<br />
"My name is Order: do not cry, my love;<br />
Attend to me, and thus you may improve."<br />
She took the silks, and drew out shade by shade,<br />
In separate skeins, and each with care she laid;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>Then smiling kindly, left the little maid.<br />
<br />
She leaves the room&mdash;"I've done my task," she cries,<br />
The lady look'd, and scarce believed her eyes;<br />
Yet soon her harshness changed to glad surprise:<br />
"Why, this is well, a very pretty flower,<br />
Work'd so exact, and done within the hour!<br />
And now amuse yourself, and walk, or play."<br />
Thus pass'd Matilda this much dreaded day.<br />
At all her tasks, Disorder would attend;<br />
At all her tasks, still Order stood her friend.<br />
With tears and sighs her studies oft began,<br />
These into smiles were changed by Order's plan.<br />
No longer Lady Rigid seem'd severe:<br />
The negligent alone her eye need fear.<br />
<br />
And now the day, the wish'd-for day, is come,<br />
When young Matilda may revisit home.<br />
"You quit me, child, but oft to mind recall<br />
The time you spent with me at Austere Hall.<br />
And now, my dear, I'll give you one of these<br />
To be your maid&mdash;take with you which you please.<br />
What! from Disorder do you frighten'd start?"<br />
Matilda clasp'd sweet Order to her heart,<br />
And said, "From thee, best friend, I'll never part."<br />

<h2>THE VIOLET.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class='smcap'>Down</span> in a green and shady bed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A modest violet grew;</span><br />
Its stalk was bent, it hung its head<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As if to hide from view.</span><br />
<br />
And yet it was a lovely flower,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its colour bright and fair;</span><br />
It might have graced a rosy bower,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Instead of hiding there.</span><br />
<br />
Yet thus it was content to bloom,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In modest tints arrayed;</span><br />
And there diffused a sweet perfume<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within the silent shade.</span><br />
<br />
Then let me to the valley go<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This pretty flower to see;</span><br />
That I may also learn to grow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In sweet humility.</span><br />

<h2>THE ORPHAN.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class='smcap'>My</span> father and mother are dead,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor friend, nor relation I know;</span><br />
And now the cold earth is their bed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And daisies will over them grow.</span><br />
<br />
I cast my eyes into the tomb,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sight made me bitterly cry;</span><br />
I said, "And is this the dark room,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where my father and mother must lie?"</span><br />
<br />
I cast my eyes round me again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In hopes some protector to see;</span><br />
Alas! but the search was in vain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For none had compassion on me.</span><br />
<br />
I cast my eyes up to the sky,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I groan'd, though I said not a word;</span><br />
Yet God was not deaf to my cry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Friend of the fatherless heard.</span><br />
<br />
For since I have trusted his care,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And learn'd on his word to depend,</span><br />
He has kept me from every snare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And been my best Father and Friend.</span><br />

<h2>THE DISAPPOINTMENT.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class='smcap'>In</span> tears to her mother poor Harriet came,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let us listen to hear what she says:</span><br />
"O see, dear mamma, it is pouring with rain,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">We cannot go out in the chaise.</span><br />
<br />
"All the week I have long'd for this holiday so,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And fancied the minutes were hours;</span><br />
And now that I'm dress'd and all ready to go,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Do look at those terrible showers!"</span><br />
<br />
"I'm sorry, my dear," her kind mother replied,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The rain disappoints us to-day;</span><br />
But sorrow still more that you fret for a ride,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In such an extravagant way.</span><br />
<br />
"These slight disappointments are sent to prepare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For what may hereafter befall;</span><br />
For seasons of <em>real</em> disappointment and care,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which commonly happen to all.</span><br />
<br />
"For just like to-day with its holiday lost,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is life and its comforts at best:</span><br />
Our pleasures are blighted, our purposes cross'd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To teach us it is not our rest.</span><br />
<br />
"And when those distresses and crosses appear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With which you may shortly be tried,</span><br />
You'll wonder that ever you wasted a tear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On merely the loss of a ride.</span><br />
<br />
"But though the world's pleasures are fleeting and vain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Religion is lasting and true;</span><br />
Real pleasure and peace in her paths you may gain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor will disappointment ensue."</span><br />

<h2>JAMES AND THE SHOULDER OF MUTTON.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class='smcap'>Young</span> Jem at noon return'd from school,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As hungry as could be,</span><br />
He cried to Sue, the servant-maid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"My dinner give to me."</span><br />
<br />
Said Sue, "It is not yet come home;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Besides, it is not late."</span><br />
"No matter that," cries little Jem,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I do not like to wait."</span><br />
<br />
Quick to the baker's Jemmy went<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And ask'd, "Is dinner done?"</span><br />
"It is," replied the baker's man.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Then home I'll with it run."</span><br />
<br />
"Nay, Sir," replied he prudently,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I tell you 'tis too hot,</span><br />
And much too heavy 'tis for you."<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I tell you it is not.</span><br />

"Papa, mamma, are both gone out,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I for dinner long;</span><br />
So give it me, it is all mine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, baker, hold your tongue.</span><br />
<br />
"A shoulder 'tis of mutton nice!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And batter-pudding too;</span><br />
I'm glad of that, it is so good;<br />

Now near the door young Jem was come,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He round the corner turn'd,</span><br />
But oh, sad fate! unlucky chance!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The dish his fingers burn'd.</span><br />
<br />
Now in the kennel down fell dish,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And down fell all the meat;</span><br />
Swift went the pudding in the stream,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sail'd along the street.</span><br />
<br />
The people laugh'd, and rude boys grinn'd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At mutton's hapless fall;</span><br />
But though ashamed, young Jemmy cried.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Better lose part than all."</span><br />
<br />
The shoulder by the knuckle seized,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His hands both grasp'd it fast,</span><br />
And deaf to all their gibes and cries,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He gain'd his home at last.</span><br />
<br />
"Impatience is a fault," cries Jem,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"The baker told me true;</span><br />
In future I will patient be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And mind what says our Sue."</span><br />

If one wants a thing that the other would like&mdash;<br />
Well,&mdash;what do they do? Must they quarrel and strike?<br />
No, each is so willing to give up her own,<br />

<br />
If one of them happens to have something nice,<br />
Directly she offers her sister a slice;<br />
And never, like some greedy children, would try<br />
To eat in a corner with nobody by!<br />
<br />
When papa or mamma has a job to be done,<br />
These good little children immediately run;<br />
Nor dispute whether this or the other should go,<br />
They <em>would</em> be ashamed to behave themselves so!<br />
<br />
Whatever occurs, in their work or their play,<br />
They are willing to yield, and give up their own way:<br />
Then now let us try their example to mind,<br />
And always, like them, be obliging and kind.<br />

Did she forget that <span class="smcap">God</span> could see<br />
And hear, wherever she might be?<br />
<br />
He made your eyes, and can discern<br />
Whichever way you think to turn;<br />

In every place, by night or day,<br />
He watches all you do and say.<br />

So long as you your crime conceal,<br />
You cannot light and gladsome feel:<br />
Your little heart will seem oppress'd,<br />

And e'en your mother's eye to meet,<br />
Will tinge your face with shame and heat.<br />

Yes, <span class="smcap">God</span> has made your duty clear,<br />

His friends were much hurt<br />

But all was in vain,<br />
He got dirty again,<br />

It gave him no pain<br />

<div class='poem'>
<span class='smcap'>One</span> ugly trick has often spoil'd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sweetest and the best;</span><br />
Matilda, though a pleasant child,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One ugly trick possess'd,</span><br />
Which, like a cloud before the skies,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>Hid all her better qualities.<br />
<br />
Sometimes she'd lift the tea-pot lid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To peep at what was in it;</span><br />
Or tilt the kettle, if you did<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But turn your back a minute.</span><br />
In vain you told her not to touch,<br />
Her trick of meddling grew so much.<br />
<br />
Her grandmamma went out one day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And by mistake she laid</span><br />
Her spectacles and snuff-box gay<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Too near the little maid;</span><br />
"Ah! well," thought she, "I'll try them on,<br />
As soon as grandmamma is gone."<br />
<br />
Forthwith she placed upon her nose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The glasses large and wide;</span><br />
And looking round, as I suppose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The snuff-box too she spied:</span><br />
"Oh! what a pretty box is that;<br />
I'll open it," said little Matt.<br />
<br />
"I know that grandmamma would say,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Don't meddle with it, dear;'</span><br />
But then, she's far enough away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And no one else is near:</span><br />
Besides, what can there be amiss<br />
In opening such a box as this?"<br />
<br />
So thumb and finger went to work<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To move the stubborn lid,</span><br />
And presently a mighty jerk<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The mighty mischief did;</span><br />
For all at once, ah! woful case,<br />
The snuff came puffing in her face.<br />
<br />
Poor eyes, and nose, and mouth, beside<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A dismal sight presented;</span><br />
In vain, as bitterly she cried,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her folly she repented.</span><br />
In vain she ran about for ease;<br />
She could do nothing now but sneeze.<br />
<br />
She dash'd the spectacles away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To wipe her tingling eyes,</span><br />
And as in twenty bits they lay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her grandmamma she spies.</span><br />
"Heyday! and what's the matter now?"<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>Says grandmamma, with lifted brow.<br />
<br />
Matilda, smarting with the pain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And tingling still, and sore,</span><br />
Made many a promise to refrain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From meddling evermore.</span><br />
And 'tis a fact, as I have heard,<br />
She ever since has kept her word.<br />

While beauty fails to stir our love,<br />

<h2>GEORGE AND THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class='smcap'>His</span> petticoats now George cast off,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For he was four years old;</span><br />
His trousers were of nankeen stuff,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With buttons bright as gold.</span><br />
"May I," said George, "just go abroad,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My pretty clothes to show?</span><br />
May I, mamma? but speak the word;"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The answer was, "No, no."</span><br />
<br />
"Go, run below, George, in the court.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But go not in the street,</span><br />
Lest boys with you should make some sport,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or gipsies you should meet."</span><br />
Yet, though forbidden, he went out,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That other boys might spy,</span><br />
And proudly there he walk'd about,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thought&mdash;"How fine am I!"</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With looks both vain and pert,</span><br />
A sweep-boy pass'd, whom not to meet,<br />

The sooty lad, whose heart was kind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To help him quickly ran,</span><br />
And grasp'd his arm, with&mdash;"Never mind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You're up, my little man."</span><br />
<br />
Sweep wiped his clothes with labour vain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And begg'd him not to cry;</span><br />
And when he'd blacken'd every stain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said, "Little sir, good-bye."</span><br />
Poor George, almost as dark as sweep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And smear'd in dress and face,</span><br />
Bemoans with sobs, both loud and deep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His well-deserved disgrace.</span><br />

<h2>DEAF MARTHA.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class='smcap'>Poor</span> Martha is old, and her hair is turn'd grey,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And her hearing has left her for many a year;</span><br />
Ten to one if she knows what it is that you say,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though she puts her poor wither'd hand close to her ear</span><br />
<br />
I've seen naughty children run after her fast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And cry, "Martha, run, there's a bullock so bold;"</span><br />
And when she was frighten'd,&mdash;laugh at her at last,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because she believed the sad stories they told.</span><br />
<br />
I've seen others put their mouths close to her ear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And make signs as if they had something to say;</span><br />
And when she said, "Master, I'm deaf, and can't hear,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Point at her and mock her, and scamper away.</span><br />
<br />
Ah! wicked the children poor Martha to tease,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As if she had not enough else to endure;</span><br />
They rather should try her affliction to ease,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And soothe a disorder that nothing can cure.</span><br />
<br />
One day, when those children themselves are grown old,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And one may be deaf, and another be lame,</span><br />
Perhaps they may find that some children, as bold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">May tease them, and mock them, and serve them the same.</span><br />
<br />
Then, when they reflect on the days of their youth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A faithful account will their consciences keep,</span><br />
And teach them, with shame and with sorrow, the truth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That "what a man soweth, the same shall he reap."</span><br />

<h2>THE LITTLE CRIPPLE'S COMPLAINT.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class='smcap'>I'm</span> a helpless cripple child,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gentle Christians, pity me;</span><br />
Once, in rosy health I smiled,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Blithe and gay as you can be,</span><br />
And upon the village green<br />
First in every sport was seen.<br />
<br />
Now, alas! I'm weak and low,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cannot either work or play;</span><br />
Tottering on my crutches, slow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus I drag my weary way:</span><br />
Now no longer dance and sing,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>Gaily, in the merry ring.<br />
<br />
Many sleepless nights I live,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Turning on my weary bed;</span><br />
Softest pillows cannot give<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Slumber to my aching head;</span><br />
Constant anguish makes it fly<br />
From my heavy, wakeful eye.<br />
<br />
And, when morning beams return,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Still no comfort beams for me:</span><br />
Still my limbs with fever burn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Painful still my crippled knee.</span><br />
And another tedious day<br />
Passes slow and sad away.<br />
<br />
From my chamber-window high,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lifted to my easy-chair,</span><br />
I the village-green can spy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Once <em>I</em> used to frolic there,</span><br />
March, or beat my new-bought drum;<br />
Happy times! no more to come.<br />
<br />
There I see my fellows gay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sporting on the daisied turf,</span><br />
And, amidst their cheerful play,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stopp'd by many a merry laugh;</span><br />
But the sight I scarce can bear,<br />
Leaning in my easy-chair.<br />
<br />
Let not then the scoffing eye<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Laugh, my twisted leg to see:</span><br />
Gentle Christians, passing by,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stop awhile, and pity me,</span><br />
And for you I'll breathe a prayer,<br />
Leaning in my easy-chair.<br />

<h2>NEGLIGENT MARY.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class='smcap'>Ah</span>, Mary! what, do you for dolly not care?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And why is she left on the floor?</span><br />
Forsaken, and cover'd with dust, I declare;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With you I must trust her no more.</span><br />
<br />
I thought you were pleased, as you took her so gladly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When on your birthday she was sent;</span><br />
Did I ever suppose you would use her so sadly?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was that, do you think, what I meant?</span><br />
<br />
With her bonnet of straw you once were delighted,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And trimm'd it so pretty with pink;</span><br />
But now it is crumpled, and dolly is slighted:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her nurse quite forgets her, I think.</span><br />
<br />
Suppose now&mdash;for Mary is <em>dolly</em> to me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whom I love to see tidy and fair&mdash;</span><br />
Suppose I should leave you, as dolly I see,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In tatters, and comfortless there.</span><br />
<br />
But dolly feels nothing, as you do, my dear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor cares for her negligent nurse:</span><br />
If I were as careless as you are, I fear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your lot, and my fault, would be worse.</span><br />
<br />
And therefore it is, in my Mary, I strive<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To check every fault that I see:</span><br />
Mary's doll is but waxen&mdash;mamma's is alive,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And of far more importance than she.</span><br />

<h2>THE SPIDER.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
"<span class='smcap'>Oh</span>, look at that great ugly spider!" said Ann;<br />
And screaming, she brush'd it away with her fan;<br />
"'Tis a frightful black creature as ever can be,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>I wish that it would not come crawling on me."<br />
<br />
"Indeed," said her mother, "I'll venture to say,<br />
The poor thing will try to keep out of your way;<br />
For after the fright, and the fall, and the pain,<br />
It has much more occasion than you to complain.<br />
<br />
"But why should you dread the poor insect, my dear?<br />
If it <em>hurt</em> you, there'd be some excuse for your fear;<br />
But its little black legs, as it hurried away,<br />
Did but tickle your arm, as they went, I dare say.<br />
<br />
"For <em>them</em> to fear <em>us</em> we must grant to be just,<br />
Who in less than a moment can tread them to dust;<br />
But certainly <em>we</em> have no cause for alarm;<br />
For, were they to try, they could do us no harm.<br />
<br />
"Now look! it has got to its home; do you see<br />
What a delicate web it has spun in the tree?<br />
Why here, my dear Ann, is a lesson for you:<br />
Come learn from this spider what patience can do!<br />
<br />
"And when at your business you're tempted to play,<br />
Recollect what you see in this insect to-day,<br />
Or else, to your shame, it may seem to be true,<br />
That a poor little spider is wiser than you."<br />

Oh! why is this passion? remember, my child,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="smcap">God</span> sees you, who lives in the sky.</span><br />
<br />
That dear little face, that I like so to kiss,<br />

Do you think I can love you so naughty as this,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or kiss you, all wetted with tears?</span><br />
<br />
Remember, though <span class="smcap">God</span> is in Heaven, my love,<br />

And always looks down, from His glory above,<br />

His eye is as able your doings to mark,<br />

<br />
Then dry up your tears and look smiling again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And never do things that are wrong;</span><br />
For I'm sure you must feel it a terrible pain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To be naughty and crying so long.</span><br />
<br />
We'll pray, then, that <span class="smcap">God</span> may your passion forgive,<br />

And then you'll be happy as long as you live,<br />

<h2>THE CHILD'S MONITOR.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class='smcap'>The</span> wind blows down the largest tree,<br />
And yet the wind I cannot see!<br />
Playmates far off, who have been kind,<br />
My thought can bring before my mind;<br />
The past by it is present brought,<br />
And yet I cannot see my thought;<br />
The charming rose scents all the air,<br />
Yet I can see no perfume there.<br />
Blithe Robin's notes how sweet, how clear!<br />
From his small bill they reach my ear,<br />
And whilst upon the air they float,<br />
I hear, yet cannot see a note.<br />
When I would do what is forbid,<br />
By <em>something</em> in my heart I'm chid;<br />
When good, I think, then quick and pat,<br />
That <em>something</em> says, "My child, do that:"<br />
When I too near the stream would go,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>So pleased to see the waters flow,<br />
That <em>something</em> says, without a sound,<br />
"Take care, dear child, you may be drown'd:"<br />
And for the poor whene'er I grieve,<br />
That <em>something</em> says, "A penny give."<br />
<br />
Thus <em>something</em> very near must be,<br />
Although invisible to me;<br />
Whate'er I do, it sees me still:<br />

<h2>THE CHATTERBOX.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class='smcap'>From</span> morning till night it was Lucy's delight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To chatter and talk without stopping:</span><br />
There was not a day but she rattled away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like water for ever a-dropping.</span><br />
<br />
No matter at all if the subjects were small,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or not worth the trouble of saying,</span><br />
'Twas equal to her, she would talking prefer<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">To working, or reading, or playing.</span><br />
<br />
You'll think now, perhaps, that there would have been gaps,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If she had not been wonderfully clever:</span><br />
That her sense was so great, and so witty her pate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It would be forthcoming for ever;</span><br />
<br />
But that's quite absurd, for have you not heard<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That much tongue and few brains are connected?</span><br />
That they are supposed to think least who talk most,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And their wisdom is always suspected?</span><br />
<br />
While Lucy was young, had she bridled her tongue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a little good sense and exertion,</span><br />
Who knows, but she might now have been our delight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Instead of our jest and aversion?</span><br />

<h2>JANE AND ELIZA.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class='smcap'>There</span> were two little girls, neither handsome nor plain;<br />
One's name was Eliza, the other's was Jane:<br />
They were both of one height, as I've heard people say,<br />
They were both of one age, I believe, to a day.<br />
<br />
'Twas fancied by some, who but slightly had seen them,<br />
That scarcely a difference was there between them;<br />
But no one for long in this notion persisted,<br />
So great a distinction there really existed.<br />
<br />
Eliza knew well that she could not be pleasing,<br />
While fretting and fuming, while sulky or teasing;<br />
And therefore in company artfully tried,<br />
Not to <em>break</em> her bad habits, but only to <em>hide</em>.<br />
<br />
So, when she was out, with much labour and pain,<br />
She contrived to look almost as pleasant as Jane;<br />
But then you might see, that in forcing a smile,<br />
Her mouth was uneasy, and ached all the while.<br />
<br />
And in spite of her care, it would sometimes befall,<br />
That some cross event happen'd to ruin it all;<br />
And because it might chance that her share was the worst,<br />
Her temper broke loose, and her dimples dispersed.<br />
<br />
But Jane, who had nothing she wanted to hide,<br />
And therefore these troublesome arts never tried,<br />
Had none of the care and fatigue of concealing,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>But her face always show'd what her bosom was feeling.<br />
<br />
At home or abroad there was peace in her smile,<br />
A cheerful good nature that needed no guile.<br />
And Eliza work'd hard, but could never obtain<br />
The affection that freely was given to Jane.<br />

It is not to tease you and hurt you, my sweet,<br />

I don't mind the trouble, if you would not cry,<br />

<h2>THE WOODEN DOLL AND THE WAX DOLL.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class='smcap'>There</span> were two friends, a very charming pair,<br />
Brunette the brown, and Blanchidine the fair;<br />
And she to love Brunette did constantly incline,<br />
Nor less did Brunette love sweet Blanchidine.<br />
Brunette in dress was neat, yet always plain;<br />
But Blanchidine of finery was vain.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now Blanchidine a new acquaintance made&mdash;</span><br />
A little girl most sumptuously array'd,<br />
In plumes and ribbons, gaudy to behold,<br />
And India frock, with spots of shining gold.<br />
Said Blanchidine, "A girl so richly dress'd,<br />
Should surely be by everyone caress'd,<br />
To play with me if she will condescend,<br />
Henceforth 'tis she alone shall be my friend."<br />
And so for this new friend in silks adorn'd,<br />
Her poor Brunette was slighted, left, and scorn'd.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Blanchidine's vast stock of pretty toys,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>A wooden doll her every thought employs;<br />
Its neck so white, so smooth, its cheeks so red&mdash;<br />
She kiss'd, she fondled, and she took to bed.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mamma now brought her home a doll of wax,</span><br />
Its hair in ringlets white, and soft as flax;<br />
Its eyes could open and its eyes could shut;<br />
And on it, too, with taste its clothes were put.<br />
"My dear wax doll!" sweet Blanchidine would cry&mdash;<br />
Her doll of wood was thrown neglected by.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One summer's day, 'twas in the month of June,</span><br />
The sun blazed out in all the heat of noon:<br />
"My waxen doll," she cried, "my dear, my charmer!<br />
What, are you cold? but you shall soon be warmer."<br />
She laid it in the sun&mdash;misfortune dire!<br />
The wax ran down as if before the fire!<br />
Each beauteous feature quickly disappear'd,<br />
And melting, left a blank all soil'd and smear'd.<br />
Her doll disfigured, she beheld amazed,<br />
And thus express'd her sorrow as she gazed:<br />
"Is it for you my heart I have estranged<br />
From that I fondly loved, which has not changed?<br />
Just so may change my new acquaintance fine,<br />
For whom I left Brunette that friend of mine.<br />
No more by outside show will I be lured;<br />
Of such capricious whims I think I'm cured:<br />
To plain old friends my heart shall still be true,<br />
Nor change for every face because 'tis new."<br />
Her slighted wooden doll resumed its charms,<br />
And wronged Brunette she clasp'd within her arms.<br />

<h2>THE PIN.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
"<span class='smcap'>Dear</span> me! what signifies a pin!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll leave it on the floor;</span><br />
My pincushion has others in,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mamma has plenty more:</span><br />
A miser will I never be,"<br />
Said little heedless Emily.<br />
<br />
So tripping on to giddy play,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She left the pin behind,</span><br />
For Betty's broom to whisk away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or some one else to find;</span><br />
She never gave a thought, indeed,<br />
To what she might to-morrow need.<br />
<br />
Next day a party was to ride,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To see an air-balloon!</span><br />
And all the company beside<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were dress'd and ready soon:</span><br />
But she, poor girl, she could not stir,<br />
For just a pin to finish her.<br />
<br />
'Twas vainly now, with eye and hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She did to search begin;</span><br />
There was not one&mdash;not one, the band<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of her pelisse to pin!</span><br />
She cut her pincushion in two,<br />
But not a pin had slidden through!<br />
<br />
At last, as hunting on the floor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over a crack she lay,</span><br />
The carriage rattled to the door,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then rattled fast away.</span><br />
Poor Emily! she was not in,<br />
For want of just&mdash;a single pin!<br />
<br />
There's hardly anything so small,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So trifling or so mean,</span><br />
That we may never want at all,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For service unforeseen:</span><br />
And those who venture wilful waste,<br />
May woful want expect to taste.<br />

<h2>FINERY.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class='smcap'>In</span> an elegant frock, trimm'd with beautiful lace,<br />
And hair nicely curl'd, hanging over her face,<br />
Young Fanny went out to the house of a friend,<br />
With a large <em>little</em> party the evening to spend.<br />
<br />
"Ah! how they will all be delighted, I guess,<br />
And stare with surprise at my handsome new dress!"<br />
Thus said the vain girl, and her little heart beat,<br />
Impatient the happy young party to meet.<br />
<br />
But, alas! they were all too intent on their play<br />
To observe the fine clothes of this lady so gay,<br />
And thus all her trouble quite lost its design;&mdash;<br />
For they saw she was proud, but forgot she was fine.<br />
<br />
'Twas Lucy, though only in simple white clad,<br />
(Nor trimmings, nor laces, nor jewels, she had,)<br />
Whose cheerful good-nature delighted them more<br />
Than Fanny and all the fine garments she wore.<br />
<br />
'Tis better to have a sweet smile on one's face,<br />
Than to wear a fine frock with an elegant lace,<br />
For the good-natured girl is loved best in the main,<br />
If her dress is but decent, though ever so plain.<br />

<h2>GREEDY RICHARD.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
"<span class='smcap'>I think</span> I want some pies this morning,"<br />
Said Dick, stretching himself and yawning;<br />
So down he threw his slate and books,<br />
And saunter'd to the pastry-cook's.<br />
<br />
And there he cast his greedy eyes<br />
Round on the jellies and the pies,<br />
So to select, with anxious care,<br />
The very nicest that was there.<br />
<br />
At last the point was thus decided:<br />
As his opinion was divided<br />
'Twixt pie and jelly, being loth<br />
Either to leave, he took them both.<br />
<br />
Now Richard never could be pleased<br />
To stop when hunger was appeased,<br />
But would go on to eat still more<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>When he had had an ample store.<br />
<br />
"No, not another now," said Dick;<br />
"Dear me, I feel extremely sick:<br />
I cannot even eat this bit;<br />
I wish I had not tasted it."<br />
<br />
Then slowly rising from his seat,<br />
He threw his cheesecake in the street,<br />
And left the tempting pastry-cook's<br />
With very discontented looks.<br />
<br />
Just then a man with wooden leg<br />
Met Dick, and held his hat to beg;<br />
And while he told his mournful case,<br />
Look'd at him with imploring face.<br />
<br />
Dick, wishing to relieve his pain,<br />
His pockets search'd, but search'd in vain;<br />
And so at last he did declare,<br />
He had not left a farthing there.<br />
<br />
The beggar turn'd with face of grief,<br />
And look of patient unbelief,<br />
While Richard now his folly blamed,<br />
And felt both sorry and ashamed.<br />
<br />
"I wish," said he (but wishing's vain),<br />
"I had my money back again,<br />
And had not spent my last, to pay<br />
For what I only threw away.<br />
<br />
"Another time I'll take advice,<br />
And not buy things because they're nice;<br />
But rather save my little store,<br />
To give to those who want it more."<br />

<h2>THE HOLIDAYS.</h2>

"<span class='smcap'>Ah!</span> don't you remember, 'tis almost December,<br />

Oh, 'twill be so funny, I've plenty of money,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll buy me a sword and a drum."</span><br />
<br />
Thus said little Harry, unwilling to tarry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Impatient from school to depart;</span><br />
But we shall discover, this holiday lover<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Knew little what was in his heart.</span><br />
<br />
For when on returning, he gave up his learning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Away from his sums and his books,</span><br />
Though playthings surrounded, and sweetmeats abounded,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Chagrin still appear'd in his looks.</span><br />
<br />
Though first they delighted, his toys were now slighted,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thrown away out of his sight;</span><br />
He spent every morning in stretching and yawning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet went to bed weary at night.</span><br />
<br />
He had not that treasure which really makes pleasure,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(A secret discover'd by few).</span><br />
You'll take it for granted, more playthings he wanted;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh no&mdash;it was something to do.</span><br />
<br />
We must have employment to give us enjoyment<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And pass the time cheerfully away;</span><br />
And study and reading give pleasure, exceeding<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The pleasures of toys and of play.</span><br />
<br />
To school now returning&mdash;to study and learning<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With eagerness Harry applied;</span><br />
He felt no aversion to books or exertion,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor yet for the holidays sigh'd.</span><br />

<br />
Now they frolic hand in hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Making many a merry chain;</span><br />
Then they form a warlike band,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Marching o'er the level plain.</span><br />

Now ascends the worsted ball,<br />

<h2>MISCHIEF.</h2>

<span class='smcap'>Let</span> those who're fond of idle tricks,<br />
Of throwing stones, and hurling bricks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all that sort of fun,</span><br />
Now hear a tale of idle Jim,<br />
That warning they may take by him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor do as he has done.</span><br />
<br />
In harmless sport or healthful play<br />
He did not pass his time away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor took his pleasure in it;</span><br />
For mischief was his only joy:<br />
No book, or work, or even toy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Could please him for a minute.</span><br />
<br />
A neighbour's house he'd slyly pass,<br />
And throw a stone to break the glass,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then enjoy the joke!</span><br />
Or, if a window open stood,<br />
He'd throw in stones, or bits of wood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To frighten all the folk.</span><br />
<br />
If travellers passing chanced to stay,<br />
Of idle Jim to ask the way,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He never told them right;</span><br />
And then, quite harden'd in his sin,<br />
Rejoiced to see them taken in,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And laugh'd with all his might.</span><br />
<br />
He'd tie a string across the street,<br />
Just to entangle people's feet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And make them tumble down:</span><br />
Indeed, he was disliked so much,<br />
That no good boy would play with such<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A nuisance to the town.</span><br />
<br />
At last the neighbours, in despair,<br />
This mischief would no longer bear:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so&mdash;to end the tale,</span><br />
This lad, to cure him of his ways,<br />
Was sent to spend some dismal days<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within the county jail.</span><br />

Which bore the best codlins that ever were seen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So juicy, so mellow, and red;</span><br />
And when they were ripe, he disposed of his store,<br />
To children or any who pass'd by his door,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To buy him a morsel of bread.</span><br />
<br />
Little Dick, his next neighbour, one often might see,<br />
With longing eye viewing this fine apple-tree,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wishing a codlin might fall:</span><br />
One day as he stood in the heat of the sun,<br />
He began thinking whether he might not take one,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then he look'd over the wall.</span><br />
<br />
And as he again cast his eye on the tree,<br />
He said to himself, "Oh, how nice they would be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So cool and refreshing to-day!</span><br />
The tree is so full, and one only I'll take,<br />
And John cannot see if I give it a shake,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And nobody is in the way."</span><br />
<br />
But stop, little boy, take your hand from the bough,<br />
Remember, though John cannot see you just now,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And no one to chide you is nigh,</span><br />
There is One, who by night, just as well as by day,<br />
Can see all you do, and can hear all you say,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From his glorious throne in the sky.</span><br />
<br />
O then little boy, come away from the tree,<br />
Lest tempted to this wicked act you should be:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twere better to starve than to steal;</span><br />
For the great <span class="smcap">God</span>, who even through darkness can look,<br />
Writes down every crime we commit, in His book;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor forgets what we try to conceal.</span><br />
